# MealDeal

Aimed for fitness enthusiasts, MealDeal is a nutrition planning application that allows its users to monitor their calorie & micronutrient intake for each meal they consume. MealDeal can be used for a variety of use cases: weight loss, weight gain or just general nutrient intake management.

## How it works 

At the core of MealDeal lie two concepts: _meals_ and _plans_.

### Meals

Users build their own meals by picking individual foods from a database and providing the desired amount of each food.

MealDeal provides real-time feedback of the meal's current nutritional content, allowing the user to make necessary changes if needed.

Once the meal is ready, the user must provide necessary metadata about the meal before it can be inserted into the database.

Users may browse, edit and delete their meals in the _Browse meals_ section of the page.
